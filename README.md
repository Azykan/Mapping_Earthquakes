# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Project Plan
### Purpose
The purpose of my project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.
### Tasks
To complete this project, I used a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieved geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then I added the data to a map.
- Set up a Mapbox account and get the API token needed to create geographical maps.
- Create engaging and dynamic charts to share my information with my audience.
### Approach
- Use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. 
- Use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
- Use Content Delivery Network (CDN) to provide a link to downloadable resources, such as Plotly library code. Using this particular CDN ensures that the most up-to-date version of Plotly is always delivered.
### Tools used
- VS Code: a text editor to create and edit HTML and JavaScript files.
- Web browser: Chrome, to view, inspect, and debug my visualizations.
- Command-line interface: To run a local server I used Git Bash for Windows.
- GitHub: I deployed the final data visualization on GitHub Pages.
create engaging and dynamic charts. It's her task to identify the best way to share her information with her audience
